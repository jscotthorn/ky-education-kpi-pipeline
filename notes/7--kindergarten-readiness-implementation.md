# Kindergarten Readiness ETL Implementation

**Date**: 2025-07-18  
**Status**: ✅ Complete and Updated - Now includes all demographics  
**Pipeline**: Kindergarten readiness data processing (2021-2024)

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive ETL pipeline for Kentucky kindergarten readiness data, following the same patterns and requirements as the graduation rates pipeline. The implementation handles significant data format differences across years while maintaining consistent KPI output.

## Key Data Challenges Addressed

### 1. **Multi-Format Data Structure**
- **2024**: Count-based format with state-level aggregation
- **2021-2023**: Percentage-based format with district-level data only
- **2021**: Additional enrollment and testing data available
- **2022-2023**: Rate percentages only, no count data

### 2. **Column Name Variations**
- Case inconsistencies: `TOTAL PERCENT READY` vs `Total Percent Ready`
- Different field names across years
- Comprehensive column normalization implemented

### 3. **Data Quality Issues**
- 26,000+ suppressed records per file filtered out
- Missing/empty values handled appropriately
- Rate validation (0-100% range) implemented

### 4. **Demographic and Prior Setting Filtering**
- **Multiple Demographics**: Processes all demographic groups (All Students, Female, Male, etc.)
- **Prior Setting Focus**: Filters to "All Students" prior setting for overall district/school totals
- **Demographic Mapping**: Standardizes all demographic labels for consistency

## Implementation Details

### **Files Created:**
1. **`etl/kindergarten_readiness.py`** - Main ETL module (562 lines)
2. **`tests/test_kindergarten_readiness_end_to_end.py`** - Comprehensive test suite (373 lines)

### **ETL Pipeline Features:**
- **Demographic Inclusion**: Processes ALL demographics from the DEMOGRAPHIC column
- **Prior Setting Filtering**: Filters to "All Students" prior setting for district/school totals
- **Multi-Format Processing**: Handles both count and percentage data
- **Demographic Mapping**: Uses same standardization as graduation rates
- **Data Validation**: Rate ranges, count consistency, suppression handling
- **Audit Trail**: Complete demographic mapping audit log

### **KPI Metrics Generated:**
- `kindergarten_readiness_rate` - Percentage ready (all years)
- `kindergarten_readiness_count` - Number of students ready (2021 + calculated from 2024 counts)
- `kindergarten_readiness_total` - Total students tested (2021 + calculated from 2024 counts)

## Processing Results

### **Data Volume Processed:**
- **Total KPI Rows**: 6,430
- **Source Files**: 4 (2021-2024)
- **Records per Year**:
  - 2021: 2,214 KPI rows (full data with counts)
  - 2022: 847 KPI rows (rates only)
  - 2023: 843 KPI rows (rates only)  
  - 2024: 2,526 KPI rows (calculated from counts)

### **Metrics Distribution:**
- **Rate Metrics**: 3,269 rows (all years)
- **Count Metrics**: 1,579 rows (2021 + calculated 2024)
- **Total Metrics**: 1,582 rows (2021 + calculated 2024)

### **Data Quality Validation:**
- **737 complete metric sets** validated (rate + count + total)
- **100% calculation accuracy** within reasonable tolerances
- **Zero data integrity errors**
- **All required demographics present**

## Technical Implementation

### **Column Normalization Mapping:**
```python
'TOTAL PERCENT READY': 'total_percent_ready'
'Total Ready': 'total_ready_count' 
'NUMBER TESTED': 'number_tested'
'Ready With Interventions': 'ready_with_interventions_count'
```

### **Data Filtering Logic:**
1. **Suppression Filter**: Remove `Suppressed = 'Y'` records
2. **Prior Setting Filter**: Use `'All Students'` prior setting for district/school totals
3. **Demographic Processing**: Include ALL demographics from DEMOGRAPHIC column
4. **Quality Filter**: Validate rate ranges and count values

### **KPI Generation Strategy:**
```python
# 2021-2023: Percentage to count conversion
ready_count = int((ready_rate / 100) * total_tested)

# 2024: Count to percentage conversion  
ready_rate = (total_ready_count / total_tested) * 100
```

### **Demographic Integration:**
- **Mapping Applied**: All demographics standardized via `DemographicMapper`
- **Audit Trail**: All demographic mapping decisions logged
- **Validation**: Multiple demographic groups processed and standardized

## Test Coverage

### **Test Suite: 8 Tests, All Passing ✅**

1. **Source to KPI Transformation** - Validates data flow from each source file
2. **KPI Format Compliance** - Ensures long KPI format with required columns  
3. **Metric Coverage** - Validates expected metrics present
4. **Source File Tracking** - Confirms audit trail for all source files
5. **Student Group Consistency** - Validates multiple demographic groups
6. **Expanded KPI Format** - Tests rate/count/total metric relationships
7. **Year Coverage** - Confirms all years (2021-2024) processed
8. **Demographic Mapping Integration** - Validates standardization audit trail

### **Key Test Validations:**
- **Rate Calculation Consistency**: All complete metric sets validated
- **Data Relationships**: Count ≤ Total, Rate = (Count/Total) × 100
- **File Coverage**: All 4 source files contribute data
- **Format Compliance**: Long KPI format with 9 required columns
- **Demographic Coverage**: Multiple demographic groups processed

## Data Output Structure

### **Sample KPI Output:**
```csv
district,school_id,school_name,year,student_group,metric,value,source_file,last_updated
Adair County,1,---District Total---,2021,All Students,kindergarten_readiness_rate,29.1,kindergarten_screen_2021.csv,2025-07-18T12:54:26.574037
Adair County,1,---District Total---,2021,All Students,kindergarten_readiness_count,48.0,kindergarten_screen_2021.csv,2025-07-18T12:54:26.574037
