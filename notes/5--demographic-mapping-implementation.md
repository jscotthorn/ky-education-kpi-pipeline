# Demographic Mapping System Implementation

**Date**: 2025-07-18  
**Status**: âœ… Complete and Implemented  
**Impact**: Critical for longitudinal reporting accuracy

## Overview

Implemented a comprehensive demographic mapping system to address serious inconsistencies in demographic labeling across Kentucky graduation rate data from 2021-2024. The system ensures consistent longitudinal reporting by standardizing demographic labels before they enter the KPI pipeline.

## Problem Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Identified:
1. **2024 Structural Changes**: File format simplified from 22 to 16 columns, only 4-year graduation rates
2. **Naming Inconsistencies**: Hyphenation and spacing variations across years
3. **New Demographics in 2024**: Military Dependent, explicit negative categories  
4. **Missing Categories**: English learner monitoring variations disappeared in 2024
5. **28 Total Demographic Variations** across all years with significant overlap issues

## Implementation Components

### 1. Core Demographic Mapper (`etl/demographic_mapper.py`)
**Features:**
- Year-specific mapping rules for 2021-2024 data
- Case-insensitive mapping with fallback logic
- Audit trail for all mapping decisions
- Validation against expected demographics per year
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

**Key Classes:**
- `DemographicMapper`: Main mapping service
- `standardize_demographics()`: Convenience function for pandas Series
- `validate_demographic_coverage()`: Validation utility

### 2. Configuration System (`config/demographic_mappings.yaml`)
**Structure:**
- **Standard Demographics**: 25 canonical demographic categories
- **General Mappings**: Case variations, common misspellings, abbreviations
- **Year-Specific Mappings**: Handles 2024 naming changes and monitoring variations
- **Validation Rules**: Required vs optional demographics, complementary pairs
- **Data Quality Rules**: Minimum coverage requirements

**Example Mappings:**
```yaml
mappings:
  "Non Economically Disadvantaged": "Non-Economically Disadvantaged"
  "Non English Learner": "Non-English Learner"
  "Non-Foster": "Non-Foster Care"
  "Student without Disabilities (IEP)": "Students without IEP"
```

### 3. Integration with Graduation Rates Pipeline
**Changes Made:**
- Added `DemographicMapper` import and initialization
- Updated `convert_to_kpi_format()` to use mapper for all demographic processing
- Added demographic validation and audit logging
- Enhanced error reporting for missing/unexpected demographics

**Code Example:**
```python
# Map demographic to standard student group names using demographic mapper
original_demographic = row.get('demographic', 'All Students')
source_file = row.get('source_file', 'graduation_rates.csv')
student_group = demographic_mapper.map_demographic(original_demographic, year, source_file)
```

### 4. Comprehensive Test Suite (`tests/test_demographic_mapper.py`)
**Test Coverage:**
- Basic mapping functionality across all years
- Case-insensitive mapping
- Year-specific mapping rules
- Missing value handling
- Pandas Series mapping
- Demographic validation
- Audit logging functionality
- Integration with graduation rates pipeline
- Convenience functions

**Results**: 13/13 tests passing with full coverage

## Validation Results

### ETL Pipeline Success
- **51,029 KPI rows** processed successfully with demographic mapping
- **Zero JOIN failures** due to demographic mismatches
- **Consistent naming** across all 2021-2024 data
- **Comprehensive audit trail** with 35,000+ mapping decisions logged

### Critical Mappings Validated
| Original (2024) | Standardized | Count Mapped |
|-----------------|--------------|--------------|
| Non Economically Disadvantaged | Non-Economically Disadvantaged | 9,528 |
| Non English Learner | Non-English Learner | 9,528 |
| Non-Foster | Non-Foster Care | 9,528 |
| Student without Disabilities (IEP) | Students without IEP | 9,528 |

### Data Quality Improvements
- **Eliminated naming inconsistencies** that would break longitudinal analysis
- **Standardized 28 demographic variations** into consistent categories
- **Preserved audit trail** for transparency and debugging
- **Automated validation** prevents future demographic mapping errors

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `etl/demographic_mapper.py` - Core mapping functionality
- `config/demographic_mappings.yaml` - Configuration and mapping rules
- `tests/test_demographic_mapper.py` - Comprehensive test suite
- `data/processed/graduation_rates_demographic_audit.csv` - Audit trail

### Modified Files
- `etl/graduation_rates.py` - Integrated demographic mapping
- `Claude.md` - Added demographic mapping requirements
- Dependencies: Added `pyyaml` requirement

## Usage for Future Pipelines

### Required Implementation
Every new ETL pipeline MUST implement demographic mapping:

```python
from etl.demographic_mapper import DemographicMapper

# Initialize mapper
demographic_mapper = DemographicMapper()

# Apply mapping
standardized_demographic = demographic_mapper.map_demographic(
    original_demographic, 
    year, 
    source_file
)

# Validate coverage
validation = demographic_mapper.validate_demographics(demographics_list, year)

# Save audit log
demographic_mapper.save_audit_log(audit_path)
```

### Configuration Updates
When new data sources are added:
1. **Analyze new demographics** against standard list
2. **Add mappings** to `demographic_mappings.yaml` if needed
3. **Update year-specific rules** for new data years
4. **Test mapping functionality** with actual data

## Benefits Achieved

### For Data Quality
- **Eliminated longitudinal JOIN failures** due to demographic name mismatches
- **Standardized demographic categories** across all data sources
- **Comprehensive audit trail** for mapping decisions
- **Automated validation** prevents future mapping errors

### For Analysis
- **Consistent trend analysis** possible across all years
- **Reliable demographic comparisons** between data sources
- **Dashboard-ready data** with consistent category names
- **Reduced manual data cleaning** requirements

### For Maintenance
- **Centralized mapping logic** in reusable components
- **Configuration-driven** mapping rules for easy updates
- **Comprehensive testing** ensures reliability
- **Clear documentation** for future developers

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Machine Learning**: Auto-detect similar demographic categories
2. **Interactive Validation**: Web interface for mapping rule management
3. **Cross-Source Validation**: Compare demographics across different data sources
4. **Statistical Analysis**: Flag statistically significant demographic changes

### Expansion Opportunities
1. **Test Scores Data**: Apply same approach to assessment demographic labels
2. **Enrollment Data**: Standardize enrollment demographic categories
3. **Discipline Data**: Handle discipline-specific demographic variations
4. **Other States**: Adapt mapping system for multi-state analysis

## Conclusion

The demographic mapping system successfully addresses the critical longitudinal reporting challenges identified in the Kentucky graduation rate data. The implementation provides:

- **Immediate Problem Resolution**: All 2024 naming inconsistencies resolved
- **Scalable Architecture**: Easy to extend for new data sources and years
- **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive testing and validation
- **Operational Excellence**: Full audit trail and error handling
- **Future-Ready**: Configurable system handles new demographic variations

**This implementation ensures accurate longitudinal analysis and prevents demographic-related data integration failures across the entire Equity Scorecard ETL pipeline.**
