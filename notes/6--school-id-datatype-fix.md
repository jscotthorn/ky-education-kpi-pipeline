# School ID Data Type Fix

**Date**: 2025-07-18  
**Issue**: School IDs appearing with .0 suffixes in output CSV files  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed and validated

## Problem

The user reported that school IDs in the result CSVs were showing .0 suffixes (e.g., "1.0", "210090000123.0"), indicating they were being interpreted as floats instead of strings.

## Root Cause

In `etl/graduation_rates.py`, the `convert_to_kpi_format()` function was extracting school IDs and converting them directly to strings without handling the case where the original data contained numeric values with decimal points.

**Problem code** (line 161):
```python
'school_id': str(school_id),
```

When `school_id` was 1.0 (float), `str(1.0)` would produce "1.0".

## Solution

Updated the school ID extraction logic in `convert_to_kpi_format()` to properly handle numeric values by converting to integer first, then to string:

```python
# Convert school_id to string without .0 suffix
if pd.notna(school_id) and school_id != '':
    try:
        # If it's a numeric value, convert to int then string to remove .0
        school_id = str(int(float(school_id)))
    except (ValueError, TypeError):
        # If conversion fails, use as string
        school_id = str(school_id)
```

**File changed**: `etl/graduation_rates.py` (lines 144-151)

## Validation

### Before Fix:
```csv
district,school_id,school_name,year,student_group,metric,value
Adair County,1.0,---District Total---,2021,All Students,graduation_rate_4_year,96.1
```

### After Fix:
```csv
district,school_id,school_name,year,student_group,metric,value
All Districts,999000,All Schools,2024,All Students,graduation_rate_4_year,92.3
```

### Test Results:
- **ETL Pipeline**: ✅ Successfully processed 51,029 KPI rows
- **School ID Validation**: ✅ All school IDs are clean integers (no .0 suffixes)
- **End-to-End Tests**: ✅ 6/6 tests passing
- **Data Quality Tests**: ✅ 5/5 tests passing

### Sample School IDs After Fix:
```
1, 1000, 1001010, 10012010, 10045010, 100501380, 100501400, 100536070, 101, 101000, ...
```

## Impact

- **Data Consistency**: School IDs now appear as clean integers across all output files
- **Dashboard Compatibility**: Eliminates potential issues with downstream systems expecting integer school IDs
- **User Experience**: Cleaner data presentation without confusing .0 suffixes
- **Backward Compatibility**: No breaking changes to existing KPI format or data structure

## Technical Notes

- The fix handles mixed data types gracefully with try/catch logic
- Preserves original string values when numeric conversion isn't possible
- Applied consistently across all graduation rate data sources (2021-2024)
- No performance impact on ETL processing time
