# KSA and CTE Pipeline Warnings Investigation and Fixes

## Overview
Investigated and resolved warnings that appear when running the ETL runner, specifically focusing on Kentucky Summative Assessment (KSA) and CTE participation pipelines.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. KSA Pipeline: Invalid content_index Warnings ✅ FIXED

**Issue:**
```
Found 514 invalid values in content_index
Found 744 invalid values in content_index
Found 235 invalid values in content_index
```

**Root Cause:**
The `content_index` column was being validated as a percentage (0-100 range), but it's actually a scale score that can exceed 100. Analysis showed:
- Min value: 3.3
- Max value: 119.1  
- 235 values above 100 (legitimate scale scores)

**Fix Applied:**
Updated `etl/kentucky_summative_assessment.py` in the `standardize_missing_values()` method:
- Separated percentage columns from scale score columns
- Content index now only validates for negative values (should be positive)
- Percentage columns (novice, apprentice, proficient, etc.) still validate 0-100 range

**Code Changes:**
```python
# Before: All columns validated 0-100
numeric_cols = ['novice', 'apprentice', 'proficient', 'distinguished', 'proficient_distinguished', 'content_index']
for col in numeric_cols:
    invalid = (df[col] < 0) | (df[col] > 100)

# After: Separated validation logic
percentage_cols = ['novice', 'apprentice', 'proficient', 'distinguished', 'proficient_distinguished']
# content_index validated separately, only for negative values
if 'content_index' in df.columns:
    invalid = df['content_index'] < 0
```

### 2. KSA Pipeline: Unexpected Demographics Warnings ✅ FIXED

**Issue:**
```
Unexpected demographics for 2022: ['Students with Disabilities/IEP Regular Assessment', 'Non-Homeless', 'Non-Migrant', 'Non-Military Dependent']
Unexpected demographics for 2023: ['Students with Disabilities/IEP Regular Assessment', 'Non-Homeless', 'Non-Migrant', 'Non-Military Dependent']  
Unexpected demographics for 2021: ['Non-Migrant', 'Non-Gifted and Talented', 'Students with Disabilities/IEP Regular Assessment', 'Students with Disabilities/IEP with Accommodations', 'Non-English Learner or monitored', 'Non-Homeless']
```

**Root Cause:**
The demographic mapping configuration file (`config/demographic_mappings.yaml`) had incomplete `available_demographics` lists for years 2021-2023. These demographics were present in the raw data but not listed as valid for those years.

**Fix Applied:**
Updated `config/demographic_mappings.yaml` to add missing demographics to year-specific available_demographics lists:

**Added to 2021:**
- `Non-Homeless`
- `Non-Migrant` 
- `Non-Gifted and Talented`
- `Non-English Learner or monitored`
- `Students with Disabilities/IEP Regular Assessment`
- `Students with Disabilities/IEP with Accommodations`
- `Students with Disabilities/IEP without Accommodations`

**Added to 2022 & 2023:**
- `Non-Homeless`
- `Non-Migrant`
- `Non-Military Dependent`
- `Students with Disabilities/IEP Regular Assessment`

**Validation Test:**
```python
# Test confirmed fix works
result = mapper.validate_demographics([
    'Students with Disabilities/IEP Regular Assessment',
    'Non-Homeless', 
    'Non-Migrant',
    'Non-Military Dependent'
], '2022')
# Result: All demographics now show as 'valid', none as 'unexpected'
```

### 3. CTE Participation Pipeline: Data Quality Warnings ✅ WORKING AS INTENDED

**Warnings Observed:**
```
Found 42 invalid CTE participation rates
Found 2162 invalid CTE participation rates  
Found 115 invalid CTE completion rates
Found 2415 invalid CTE participation rates
Found 149 invalid CTE completion rates
```

**Analysis:**
These are **legitimate data quality warnings**, not errors that need fixing:
- They identify values > 100% (invalid rates)
- They identify negative counts (invalid data)
- The pipeline correctly sets these to `pd.NA` and continues processing
- This is working as designed for data validation and cleaning

**No Action Required:** These warnings provide valuable insight into data quality issues in the source data.

### 4. English Learner Pipeline ✅ NO ISSUES FOUND

**Analysis:**
- Reviewed `etl/english_learner_progress.py`
- Found similar data quality validation warnings (percentage scores outside 0-100%)
- These are also working as intended for data quality validation
- No unexpected demographics or structural issues found

## Validation Results

### Content Index Validation Fix:
- ✅ Scale scores > 100 no longer trigger warnings
- ✅ Negative scale scores still properly flagged
- ✅ Percentage columns still validate 0-100 range

### Demographics Validation Fix:
- ✅ No more "unexpected demographics" warnings for 2021-2023
- ✅ All legitimate demographics properly recognized
- ✅ Demographic mapping still functions correctly

### Data Quality Warnings (Preserved):
- ✅ CTE participation/completion rate validation still active
- ✅ English learner percentage score validation still active
- ✅ These provide valuable data quality insights

## Files Modified

1. **`etl/kentucky_summative_assessment.py`**
   - Fixed content_index validation logic
   - Separated scale scores from percentage validation

2. **`config/demographic_mappings.yaml`**
   - Added missing demographics to 2021, 2022, 2023 available_demographics lists
   - Ensures comprehensive demographic coverage across all years

## Impact

**Before Fixes:**
- 3 content_index warnings per KSA file (false positives)
- Multiple unexpected demographics warnings (false positives)
- Legitimate data quality warnings (preserved)

**After Fixes:**
- No false positive warnings
- Legitimate data quality warnings preserved for actual data issues
- Improved confidence in pipeline validation accuracy

## Future Maintenance

1. **Monitor for new demographics** in future KDE data releases
2. **Verify content_index remains scale score** (not converted to percentage)
3. **Review data quality warnings periodically** to identify trends in source data issues
4. **Update demographic mappings** as KDE modifies demographic categories

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Test content_index validation
python3 etl/kentucky_summative_assessment.py

# Test demographic validation  
python3 -c "from etl.demographic_mapper import DemographicMapper; m=DemographicMapper(); print(m.validate_demographics(['Non-Homeless'], '2022'))"

# Full ETL runner test
python3 etl_runner.py
