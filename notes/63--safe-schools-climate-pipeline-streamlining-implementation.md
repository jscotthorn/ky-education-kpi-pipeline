# Safe Schools Climate Pipeline Streamlining Implementation

## Overview
Following the analysis in journal entry #59, implemented comprehensive streamlining of the safe_schools_climate pipeline to improve performance and maintainability by removing inefficient data processing of large survey response files.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. File Movement and Configuration Updates

**Moved excluded files to equity downloads directory:**
- `KYRC24_ACCT_Survey_Results.csv` (1.2M+ rows) → `~/Projects/jupylter playground/equity/downloads/safe_schools_climate_survey_responses/`
- All `quality_of_school_climate_and_safety_survey_*.csv` files → same directory

**Updated `config/kde_sources.yaml`:**
- Removed survey response files from `safe_schools_climate` section
- Reduced file list from 22 files to 10 files
- Retained only essential files:
  - `KYRC24_ACCT_Index_Scores.csv` (direct 2024 index scores)
  - `KYRC24_SAFE_Precautionary_Measures.csv` (2024 policy compliance)
  - `accountability_profile_*.csv` (2022-2023 historical indices)
  - `precautionary_measures_*.csv` (2020-2024 policy compliance)

### 2. Pipeline Code Updates

**Updated `etl/safe_schools_climate.py`:**
- Modified `get_files_to_process()` to exclude survey response file patterns
- Updated module docstring to reflect new data sources
- Enhanced column mappings to handle historical accountability profile variations:
  - Added `QUALITY OF SCHOOL CLIMATE AND SAFETY INDICATOR RATE` mapping
  - Added `QUALITY OF SCHOOL CLIMATE AND SAFETY INDICATOR RATING` mapping

### 3. Test Suite Updates

**Unit Tests (`tests/test_safe_schools_climate.py`):**
- Updated `test_get_files_to_process()` to reflect new file selection logic
- Added verification that survey files are properly excluded
- Added `test_extract_metrics_accountability_profile()` for historical data processing
- All 16 unit tests pass ✅

**End-to-End Tests (`tests/test_safe_schools_climate_end_to_end.py`):**
- Replaced survey index file creation with accountability profile data
- Added direct KYRC24 index scores file creation
- Updated test assertions to match new data flow:
  - 2024 data from direct index scores
  - 2023 data from accountability profiles
  - Policy compliance from precautionary measures files
- All 8 e2e tests pass ✅

## Performance Results

**Before Optimization:**
- Files processed: ~20+ files
- Largest file: `KYRC24_ACCT_Survey_Results.csv` (1.2M+ rows)
- Processing time: ~2-3 minutes

**After Optimization:**
- Files processed: 10 files
- Largest file: `KYRC24_ACCT_Index_Scores.csv` (~35K rows)
- Processing time: ~10-15 seconds
- **Performance improvement: ~90% reduction**

## Data Coverage Maintained

### KPI Availability by Year:
- **climate_index_score**: 2022, 2023, 2024 ✅
- **safety_index_score**: 2022, 2023, 2024 ✅  
- **safety_policy_compliance_rate**: 2020-2024 ✅

### Output Verification:
- Final dataset: 81,844 records
- No duplicates
- All required KPI format columns present
- Data quality maintained across all metrics

## Technical Improvements

### 1. Data Source Prioritization
- 2024: Direct index scores from `KYRC24_ACCT_Index_Scores.csv`
- 2022-2023: Combined rates from accountability profiles
- 2020-2024: Policy compliance from precautionary measures

### 2. Column Mapping Enhancements
- Added support for historical accountability profile column variations
- Improved handling of missing climate/safety data in early years (2020-2021)

### 3. Test Coverage
- Comprehensive unit test coverage (16 tests)
- End-to-end integration testing (8 tests)
- Validation of all three metric types
- Suppressed data handling verification

## Future Considerations

### Potential Survey Details Pipeline
If detailed survey analysis is needed in the future, a separate `safe_schools_survey_details` pipeline could be created to process:
- `KYRC24_ACCT_Survey_Results.csv`
- Historical survey response files
- Question-level analytics
- Response distribution analysis

### Maintenance Notes
- Monitor KDE data structure changes in future years
- Verify column mappings when new accountability profile formats are released
- Consider adding automated file size warnings for future large dataset additions

## Validation Commands

```bash
# Run pipeline
python3 etl/safe_schools_climate.py

# Run tests
python3 -m pytest tests/test_safe_schools_climate.py -v
python3 -m pytest tests/test_safe_schools_climate_end_to_end.py -v

# Verify output
head data/processed/safe_schools_climate_kpi.csv
```

## Conclusion

Successfully streamlined the safe_schools_climate pipeline achieving:
- ✅ 90% performance improvement
- ✅ Maintained complete KPI coverage for target years
- ✅ Enhanced test suite with 100% pass rate
- ✅ Improved maintainability and code clarity
- ✅ Preserved all required metrics and data quality

The pipeline now processes only essential files while maintaining full functionality, resulting in faster execution and easier maintenance.
