# ETL Warnings Investigation and Remediation Plan

**Date:** 2025-07-25  
**Issue:** Multiple warnings and errors observed during `etl_runner.py` execution  
**Status:** Phase 1 & 1A & 2 Complete - Major Issues Resolved  

## Summary

The ETL pipeline execution shows several categories of warnings and errors that need systematic investigation and remediation to ensure data quality and pipeline reliability. **Major remediation work has been completed across multiple phases**, with significant improvements to pipeline stability and data quality.

## Observed Warnings and Errors

### 1. Data Type Conversion Failures ✅ **RESOLVED**
**Pipelines:** graduation_rates, kindergarten_readiness
```
Failed to convert column grads_4_year_cohort to int64: Cannot convert non-finite values (NA or inf) to integer
Failed to convert column grads_5_year_cohort to int64: Cannot convert non-finite values (NA or inf) to integer
Failed to convert column number_tested to int64: Cannot convert non-finite values (NA or inf) to integer
```
**Impact:** Medium - Data type inconsistencies may affect downstream analysis
**Resolution:** Updated config to use nullable integer types (Int64) and enhanced base_etl.py dtype handling

### 2. Demographic Mapping Issues
**Pipelines:** chronic_absenteeism, english_learner_progress, graduation_rates, kindergarten_readiness, out_of_school_suspension, postsecondary_readiness

**Unexpected Demographics:** ✅ **RESOLVED**
- `Consolidated Student Group` (chronic_absenteeism 2023)
- `Non-Foster Care` (graduation_rates 2024, postsecondary_readiness 2024)
- `Alternate Assessment` (postsecondary_readiness 2022-2024)
- `Non-English Learner or monitored` (postsecondary_readiness 2024)

**Missing Required Demographics:**
- `American Indian or Alaska Native`, `Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander` (english_learner_progress 2020)

**Impact:** High - Demographic inconsistencies affect equity analysis completeness
**Resolution:** Updated `config/demographic_mappings.yaml` to include missing demographics in year-specific configurations

### 3. Data Processing Failures ✅ **RESOLVED**
**Pipeline:** safe_schools_events
```
No data was processed successfully
```
**Impact:** High - Complete pipeline failure prevents KPI generation
**Resolution:** Optimized derived rates calculation from nested loops to vectorized pandas operations

### 4. File Processing Errors ✅ **RESOLVED**
**Pipeline:** english_learner_progress
```
Error processing english_learner_proficiency_2021.csv: No columns to parse from file
```
**Impact:** Medium - Missing data for specific year
**Resolution:** Added empty file detection in base_etl.py to gracefully handle 0-byte files with clear warnings

### 5. Data Quality Issues ✅ **RESOLVED**
**Pipeline:** postsecondary_readiness
```
Found 511 invalid readiness rates in postsecondary_rate_with_bonus
Found 175 invalid readiness rates in postsecondary_rate_with_bonus
Found 800 invalid readiness rates in postsecondary_rate_with_bonus
```
**Impact:** High - Invalid rate calculations compromise metric accuracy
**Resolution:** Updated validation logic to allow bonus rates 0-150% (was incorrectly flagging legitimate 102-106% values)

### 6. Import/Processing Warnings ✅ **RESOLVED**
**Pipeline:** safe_schools_climate
```
DtypeWarning: Columns (10) have mixed types. Specify dtype option on import or set low_memory=False.
```
**Impact:** Low - Performance warning, may indicate data inconsistency
**Resolution:** Updated CSV reading across all pipelines to use dtype=str and low_memory=False

### 7. Safe Schools Climate Pipeline Issues ✅ **RESOLVED**
**Pipeline:** safe_schools_climate
```
DtypeWarning: Columns (10) have mixed types. Specify dtype option on import or set low_memory=False.
No valid KPI rows created
Error processing quality_of_school_climate_and_safety_survey_elementary_school_2021.csv: No columns to parse from file
```
**Impact:** High - Multiple file processing failures, no KPI data generated
**Resolution:** Fixed column mappings for survey files, updated question type logic, and improved CSV reading options

### 8. Demographic Data Truncation ✅ **RESOLVED**
**Pipeline:** safe_schools_climate  
```
No mapping found for demographic 'Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islan' in year 2023
```
**Impact:** Medium - Demographic label truncation causing mapping failures
**Resolution:** Added fallback mappings for truncated demographic labels in demographic_mappings.yaml

### 9. Safe Schools Discipline Demographics ✅ **RESOLVED**
**Pipeline:** safe_schools_discipline
```
Unexpected demographics for 2020: ['All Students', 'Two or More Races', ...]
```
**Impact:** Low - Same demographic mapping issue as other pipelines but for 2020 data
**Resolution:** Automatically resolved by Phase 1 demographic mapping updates for 2020 configuration

## Remediation Plan

## Phase 1: Critical Issues ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Status:** All Phase 1 issues have been resolved as of 2025-07-25

1. ✅ **Safe Schools Events Pipeline Failure** - Optimized derived rates calculation
