## CTE Implementation Priority Matrix

### Immediate Implementation (Next Sprint)
1. **KYRC24_CTE_Participation.csv** - Critical career readiness equity KPI module with complete demographic breakdowns

### High Priority (Following Sprint)
1. **KYRC24_CTE_Career_Readiness_Indicators.csv** - Career readiness achievement analysis (enhance with demographic data from other sources)
2. **KYRC24_CTE_Perkins_Report.csv** - Federal CTE performance tracking (institutional context for equity analysis)

### Medium Priority (Future Consideration)
1. **KYRC24_CTE_Student_Objectives.csv** - CTE pathway progression analysis
2. **KYRC24_CTE_Career_Pathways.csv** - Program capacity and completion analysis

### Low Priority (Data Archive)
1. **KYRC24_CTE_Postsecondary_Opportunities.csv** - Program catalog (no student data)

## Key CTE Insights
- **Only 1 of 6 CTE files has demographic breakdowns** - major limitation for comprehensive CTE equity analysis
- **CTE Participation file is excellent for equity KPIs** - complete demographics + clear participation/completion metrics
- **Significant equity gaps visible in participation data** - racial/ethnic disparities in CTE completion rates
- **Federal accountability measures available** but lack demographic disaggregation
- **Career readiness indicators tracked** but need demographic context for equity analysis
- **Missing: demographic breakdowns for career pathways, readiness indicators, and postsecondary opportunities**
- **Pattern: CTE follows same structure as other categories** - participation files have demographics, administrative files do not

## CTE Equity Analysis Potential
While most CTE files lack demographic breakdowns, they provide important institutional context:
1. **CTE Participation reveals major career readiness equity gaps** - clear KPI value
2. **Career readiness indicators show institutional capacity** for workforce preparation
3. **Perkins measures provide federal accountability context** for CTE performance
4. **Career pathways data shows program availability** and completion rates by field
5. **Missing link between program availability and demographic access** - cannot analyze whether high-demand pathways are accessible to equity-priority groups

## Suggestion for Better Categorization
For non-KPI data that provides valuable institutional context, consider the term **"Institutional Context Indicators"** or **"Educational Infrastructure Metrics"** instead of background data. This captures:
- Resource allocation and capacity data (financial, facilities, staffing)
- Program availability and institutional offerings
- Administrative performance measures
- Infrastructure and operational metrics
- Policy implementation tracking

These provide essential context for understanding the environment in which equity gaps occur, even if they don't directly measure student outcomes.

## Critical Equity Pattern Recognition
The data reveals a concerning pattern where students facing the greatest challenges (those in Title I schools, students of color, economically disadvantaged) systematically receive lower-quality educational resources (less experienced teachers, teachers without subject-matter expertise), while simultaneously experiencing higher rates of academic struggle (grade retention). This creates a compounding disadvantage cycle.
