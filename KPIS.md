## Naming Conventions

All KPIs follow these standard naming patterns:
- **Rates**: `{indicator}_rate_{period}` (values 0-100)
- **Counts**: `{indicator}_count_{period}` (non-negative integers)
- **Totals**: `{indicator}_total_{period}` (denominators for rate calculations)

Grade levels are normalized to: `kindergarten`, `grade_1`, `grade_2`, etc.
Education levels include: `elementary`, `middle`, `high`
